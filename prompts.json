        "prompt": "Some people think that social media has improved communication between people. Others believe it has made communication worse. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.",
        "model_answer": "Social media has revolutionized how we communicate in the digital age. On one hand, platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have enabled instant communication across borders and allowed people to maintain connections easily...\n\nOn the other hand, critics argue that face-to-face communication has declined due to excessive use of mobile devices...\n\nIn my view, social media is a tool, and its impact depends on how we use it. When used responsibly, it can enhance communication rather than harm it."
