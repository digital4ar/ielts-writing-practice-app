      "title": "Reduce Crime – Longer Sentences vs Other Methods",
      "prompt": "Some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others think there are better ways to reduce crime. To what extent do you agree or disagree?",
      "model_answer": "The debate over the most effective strategy for reducing crime remains a contentious issue in many societies. While some advocate for lengthier prison terms as a primary deterrent, I firmly believe that such punitive measures are insufficient when used in isolation. A more comprehensive approach—combining restorative justice, community-based rehabilitation, and socio-economic reform—is not only more humane but also more effective in achieving long-term reductions in criminal activity.\n\nProponents of extended incarceration argue that harsher penalties serve as a strong deterrent by instilling fear of prolonged imprisonment. This may hold true for certain categories of offenders, particularly those who commit crimes impulsively or under economic duress. However, empirical evidence suggests that recidivism rates remain high among those subjected solely to punitive sentencing without rehabilitative support. Moreover, lengthy prison terms place an immense financial burden on state resources, contributing to overcrowding and diverting attention from root causes such as poverty, lack of education, and social marginalization.\n\nConversely, alternative strategies targeting the underlying causes of criminal behavior have demonstrated greater success. For instance, educational initiatives and vocational training within communities can provide at-risk individuals with legitimate opportunities, thereby reducing their likelihood of engaging in unlawful activities. Similarly, programs emphasizing cognitive-behavioral therapy and reintegration into society have shown promising results in countries like Norway, where recidivism rates are significantly lower than global averages.\n\nIn conclusion, while extended sentences may offer short-term deterrence for specific offences, they fail to address the systemic issues driving criminality. A holistic, forward-thinking strategy—one that prioritizes prevention, education, and rehabilitation—will yield far more sustainable outcomes and foster safer, more inclusive communities.",

      "title": "Technology & Environment Problems",
      "prompt": "Technology is the main cause of environmental problems. To what extent do you agree?",
      "model_answer": "It is widely argued that technological advancement is chiefly responsible for today’s environmental issues. While it is true that modern technologies have contributed to environmental degradation, I believe it is an oversimplification to claim that technology is the primary cause, as several other significant factors are also at play.\n\nOn one hand, technology has undeniably led to various environmental problems. The mass production and consumption of electronic devices, for example, have resulted in enormous amounts of electronic waste, which is often improperly disposed of and pollutes soil and water. Furthermore, technological developments in transportation, industry, and agriculture have dramatically increased carbon emissions and resource extraction, exacerbating issues like climate change, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. The reliance on fossil fuels to power many of these technologies further intensifies environmental damage.\n\nOn the other hand, attributing environmental problems solely to technology ignores the crucial roles of human behavior, policy failures, and economic models focused on relentless growth. Unsustainable consumption patterns, poor environmental regulations, and lack of public awareness all contribute significantly to environmental decline. Crucially, technology also offers solutions: innovations in renewable energy, carbon capture, and circular economy models demonstrate its potential to mitigate environmental damage. For example, advances in solar and wind power are helping to reduce dependence on non-renewable resources, while modern recycling technologies are improving waste management worldwide.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has certainly played a major role in creating environmental problems, it is not the sole or even the main cause. Human choices, economic priorities, and inadequate governance are equally—if not more—responsible. Importantly, technology also holds the key to many potential solutions, making it both a challenge and an opportunity.",

      "prompt": "Should universities focus more on job-related skills than theory?",
      "model_answer": "In recent years, there has been increasing debate about whether universities should prioritize job-related skills over theoretical knowledge. While some argue that practical abilities are essential for employability, others believe that theory forms the foundation of advanced learning. In my view, a balanced approach that integrates both aspects is most beneficial for students and society.\n\nThere is compelling evidence that job-specific training enhances employment prospects. Graduates entering fields such as engineering, nursing, or software development benefit immensely from early exposure to real-world applications. Practical modules enable students to bridge the gap between classroom learning and workplace demands, equipping them with industry-ready competencies and confidence.\n\nNevertheless, theory provides the scaffolding upon which professional expertise is built. Core principles in disciplines such as economics, ethics, and psychology are vital for understanding broader implications and adapting to changes in the field. For example, a computer science student who understands algorithmic logic will be better positioned to learn new programming languages than one trained only in current coding practices.\n\nTo strike an optimal balance, institutions should adopt an integrated approach. Curricula must include internships, case studies, and project-based assessments alongside foundational theoretical courses. Such synergy ensures graduates are not only prepared for the workforce but also capable of lifelong learning and critical thinking.\n\nIn summary, while vocational training undeniably boosts employability, universities should not abandon theoretical instruction. A blended model fosters graduates who are both competent and intellectually equipped to navigate future challenges.",

      "model_answer": "It is increasingly evident that schools play a crucial role in shaping students’ attitudes and behaviors regarding health. I strongly concur with this perspective, as educational institutions are uniquely positioned to instill life-long habits that promote physical and mental well-being.\n\nSchools provide a structured environment where children spend a significant portion of their formative years, making them ideal institutions for delivering consistent, evidence-based guidance. Lessons covering nutrition, physical activity, and emotional resilience equip students with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their well-being. Unlike parental guidance—which may vary in quality and accessibility—school-led programs ensure uniform standards across diverse demographics.\n\nMoreover, teaching healthy habits at school yields societal benefits beyond individual health. Children who internalize these lessons are likely to pass them on to family members, generating a ripple effect. Additionally, healthier students tend to perform better academically, as research shows that regular exercise and proper nutrition enhance cognitive function and concentration.\n\nCritics may argue that health education should be the responsibility of parents, not schools. However, given the rising prevalence of childhood obesity, sedentary lifestyles, and mental health concerns, institutionalized instruction becomes not just beneficial, but necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, schools must assume a central role in promoting healthy living. By integrating comprehensive health education into curricula, they empower students with essential life skills and contribute to a healthier, more resilient generation.",

      "model_answer": "Unpaid work, such as volunteering or internships, is increasingly promoted as a means to foster students' personal and professional growth. While detractors caution against exploitation and undue pressure, I maintain that, when appropriately regulated, unpaid experiences provide unparalleled opportunities for skill development, empathy-building, and career exploration.\n\nAdvocates rightly emphasize the developmental value of unpaid work. Students gain exposure to real-world environments that textbooks cannot replicate. They develop soft skills such as teamwork, time management, and communication—all of which are highly valued in professional contexts. Volunteering in non-profit organizations or interning at local businesses allows young people to explore potential career paths while contributing positively to their communities.\n\nHowever, concerns about equity and fairness are valid. Students from less privileged backgrounds may struggle to afford the opportunity cost of unpaid work, especially if it takes time away from income-generating activities. Furthermore, some placements offer minimal supervision or educational value, effectively reducing students to free labor rather than offering genuine learning experiences.\n\nTo ensure unpaid work remains a positive influence, institutions and employers must implement clear guidelines. Educational credit, mentorship, and structured feedback should accompany such experiences. When properly supported, unpaid work can become a cornerstone of holistic development.\n\nIn conclusion, unpaid work offers substantial benefits for students, particularly in terms of personal and professional growth. With appropriate safeguards, it can be a transformative aspect of education.",

      "model_answer": "Determining the optimal age for formal schooling is a topic of ongoing discourse among educators, policymakers, and parents. While some argue that starting early capitalizes on children's natural curiosity, others suggest that delaying formal instruction until age seven supports more organic cognitive and emotional development. After evaluating both perspectives, I firmly believe that the latter approach—delayed formal education—offers superior benefits.\n\nSupporters of early formal schooling emphasize the importance of early exposure to structured learning environments. They argue that children absorb information quickly during their formative years and that early literacy and numeracy instruction lays a solid foundation for future academic success. Early entry into school also facilitates peer interaction, helping children develop social awareness and cooperation skills.\n\nConversely, advocates for delayed schooling stress the importance of unstructured play in early childhood. Research indicates that play-based learning fosters creativity, problem-solving abilities, and emotional intelligence—skills that are fundamental to long-term success. Premature formal instruction may induce stress, hinder intrinsic motivation, and limit exploratory learning, potentially causing lasting psychological effects.\n\nFinland’s education system exemplifies the benefits of later formal schooling. Finnish children typically begin reading instruction around age seven, yet consistently outperform international peers in standardized assessments. Their early years prioritize play, outdoor activities, and interpersonal development, resulting in engaged learners and confident thinkers.\n\nIn conclusion, while early schooling may seem advantageous, I firmly believe that delaying formal instruction until age seven supports deeper, more meaningful learning. Children deserve the chance to grow naturally before entering the rigors of formal academics.",

      "prompt": "In many countries, people now work from home instead of going to an office every day. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this development?",
      "model_answer": "In recent years, the trend of working from home has gained significant momentum across many countries. While this shift away from traditional office environments offers several notable benefits, it also presents certain drawbacks that merit consideration.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of remote work is increased flexibility. Employees can tailor their schedules to suit personal needs, often leading to improved work-life balance and higher job satisfaction. Parents may find it easier to manage childcare responsibilities, and individuals can avoid stressful commutes. Additionally, working from home can result in significant cost savings for both employees and employers. Workers save on transportation and daily expenses, while companies can reduce overhead costs related to office space and utilities.\n\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to this development. Remote work can lead to feelings of isolation and reduced opportunities for social interaction, which may negatively affect mental health and team cohesion. Without the structure of a physical office, some employees may struggle to maintain motivation or separate their professional and personal lives, potentially resulting in decreased productivity. Furthermore, collaboration and communication can be more challenging when relying solely on digital platforms, sometimes leading to misunderstandings or delays.\n\nIn conclusion, the rise of working from home offers significant advantages, such as flexibility and cost savings, but also introduces challenges related to isolation, communication, and work-life boundaries. To maximize the benefits of this trend, both employers and employees must adopt effective strategies to foster collaboration and maintain a healthy balance between work and personal life.",

While some argue that technological advancements have made life increasingly complex, others assert that they have simplified and enhanced our existence. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own viewpoint.\n\nOn one hand, there are compelling arguments that technology has made life more complicated. The constant influx of new devices and applications can be overwhelming, requiring individuals to continuously adapt and learn. Many feel pressured to stay updated with the latest trends or risk falling behind in both personal and professional settings. Furthermore, technology has introduced new challenges, such as digital privacy concerns, cyberbullying, and an 'always-on' culture that blurs the line between work and leisure. For example, the rise of smartphones means that work emails and messages often intrude on personal time, potentially increasing stress and reducing the quality of life.\n\nOn the other hand, technology has undoubtedly made many aspects of life easier and more efficient. Everyday tasks such as banking, shopping, and communicating with others can now be completed with just a few clicks. Innovations in healthcare have led to improved diagnostics and treatments, while advancements in transportation have made global travel faster and more accessible. In education, technology enables distance learning and instant access to information, opening up opportunities that were previously unavailable to many.\n\nIn my view, while technology has introduced some complexities, its benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. The key lies in how individuals and societies choose to manage and integrate technology into their lives. By setting healthy boundaries and using technology mindfully, we can harness its advantages while minimizing potential downsides.\n\nIn conclusion, although technology brings certain complications, I believe it has ultimately made our lives easier, more connected, and filled with greater opportunities.",

      "model_answer": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation has sparked widespread concern about potential job losses, leading to significant social and economic challenges. This essay will discuss the problems arising from increased automation and suggest practical solutions to mitigate these issues.\n\nOne major problem associated with AI-driven job displacement is rising unemployment, particularly among low-skilled workers whose roles are most susceptible to automation. This can result in increased financial insecurity, poverty, and a widening gap between the rich and the poor. Furthermore, the psychological impact of job loss—including loss of identity, reduced self-esteem, and heightened stress—can harm individuals and communities. In addition, as more people struggle to find meaningful work, social unrest and political instability may become more prevalent.\n\nTo address these challenges, both governments and the private sector must take proactive measures. First, there should be significant investment in education and re-skilling programs to prepare workers for the evolving job market. Emphasis should be placed on digital literacy, critical thinking, and skills that complement rather than compete with AI, such as creativity and interpersonal communication. Governments could also implement social safety nets, such as universal basic income or unemployment benefits, to support those affected by technological disruptions. Finally, collaboration between industry and policymakers is essential to ensure that technological progress translates into shared prosperity, rather than further inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, while AI and automation present undeniable challenges to employment, these issues can be managed through targeted education, robust social support, and effective cooperation between stakeholders.

      "model_answer": "In recent years, the widespread use of mobile applications has transformed the way people manage daily tasks. While this technological trend offers numerous advantages, it also presents certain drawbacks that need to be acknowledged.\n\nOne major advantage of mobile apps is the unprecedented level of convenience they provide. People can transfer money, pay bills, shop for groceries, or chat with friends from virtually anywhere at any time, eliminating the need to visit physical locations or adhere to business hours. This not only saves time but also makes essential services accessible to people living in remote or rural areas. Furthermore, many apps integrate security features such as fingerprint recognition or two-factor authentication, enhancing the safety of online transactions compared to traditional methods.\n\nHowever, despite these benefits, the growing reliance on mobile apps also brings several disadvantages. Firstly, issues related to privacy and data security have become increasingly prominent. Users often have to share sensitive personal and financial information, making them vulnerable to data breaches, hacking, or identity theft. Additionally, the convenience of mobile apps can sometimes encourage impulsive behavior, such as overspending or excessive screen time, which may negatively affect financial well-being and mental health. Another potential drawback is the digital divide: not everyone owns a smartphone or has access to reliable internet, which can exacerbate social and economic inequalities.\n\nIn conclusion, while mobile applications have undeniably improved convenience and accessibility for many aspects of modern life, they are not without significant risks, particularly concerning security, privacy, and social inequality. It is important for individuals to use these technologies wisely and for policymakers to ensure that protective measures are in place so that the benefits outweigh the drawbacks.",

      "model_answer": "In recent decades, there has been a noticeable decline in the amount of time that family members spend together in many societies. This trend is largely attributable to several socio-economic and technological changes, yet there are effective strategies that can be adopted to foster stronger family bonds.\n\nOne significant reason for reduced family interaction is the increasingly demanding nature of modern work and study schedules. In many households, both parents often work full-time jobs while children are engaged in extensive extracurricular activities and academic commitments. This leaves little opportunity for families to gather and communicate meaningfully. Additionally, the pervasive influence of digital technology has transformed how individuals spend their leisure time. Rather than engaging in shared family activities, many prefer to use their smartphones, watch television, or play video games independently, further eroding opportunities for face-to-face interaction.\n\nTo address this issue and rebuild familial connections, both individuals and policymakers can take proactive steps. Firstly, families should make a conscious effort to prioritize quality time, such as by designating regular family meals or planning weekend activities together. These routines not only encourage open communication but also create cherished shared memories. Secondly, governments and employers can play a supportive role by promoting work-life balance through flexible working hours or parental leave policies, thereby enabling parents to be more present at home. Lastly, public awareness campaigns could highlight the benefits of strong family relationships, encouraging people to limit screen time and invest more in personal interactions.\n\nIn conclusion, while hectic lifestyles and technological distractions have contributed to the weakening of family ties, purposeful efforts by both families and society at large can help reverse this trend and promote deeper, more meaningful connections within the household.",

      "model_answer": "In recent decades, it has become increasingly common for individuals and couples to postpone having children until later in life. This trend is influenced by a range of social, economic, and personal factors. While there are both advantages and disadvantages associated with delaying parenthood, I believe the benefits generally outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nOne primary reason why many people are choosing to have children later is the desire to focus on education and career development. In today’s competitive job market, many young adults prioritize obtaining higher qualifications and establishing themselves professionally before starting a family. Additionally, the rising cost of living, especially in urban areas, means that individuals often wait until they are more financially stable before taking on the responsibilities of parenthood. Social attitudes have also evolved, with greater acceptance of non-traditional family structures and timelines, allowing people to make choices that best suit their personal circumstances.\n\nThe advantages of this trend are significant. Older parents are typically more financially secure and emotionally mature, which can contribute to a more stable and nurturing environment for children. They are often better equipped to provide for their children's education, health, and overall well-being. Furthermore, older parents may possess greater life experience and wisdom, which can be invaluable in raising confident, well-adjusted children.\n\nHowever, there are also disadvantages to consider. Fertility naturally declines with age, which can make conception more difficult for older couples. There may also be increased health risks for both mother and child during pregnancy and childbirth. Additionally, older parents may face challenges related to energy levels and the potential for a shorter active involvement in their children's lives.\n\nIn conclusion, although postponing parenthood presents certain risks and challenges, the advantages of greater financial security, maturity, and life experience generally outweigh the disadvantages.

      "model_answer": "It is undeniable that companies allocate large portions of their budgets to advertising campaigns. There are several compelling reasons for this, and I firmly believe that advertising plays a crucial role in shaping consumer purchasing decisions.\n\nFirstly, companies invest heavily in advertising primarily to increase visibility and differentiate their products from competitors’. In today’s saturated markets, where numerous brands offer similar goods and services, standing out is essential. Advertising enables companies to highlight the unique features and advantages of their offerings, thereby attracting potential customers. Additionally, successful advertising can foster brand loyalty by repeatedly exposing consumers to a company’s message, making the brand more memorable and trusted over time.\n\nSecondly, advertising serves as a powerful tool for informing and persuading the public. Through various media channels—such as television, social media, and billboards—companies can educate consumers about new products, special offers, or improvements to existing goods. This not only generates interest but also creates a sense of urgency or desire, often prompting impulsive purchases. For instance, a compelling advertisement for a smartphone might convince a consumer to upgrade, even if their current device is still functional. Moreover, repeated exposure to advertisements can normalize certain products or lifestyles, subtly shaping societal trends and expectations.\n\nIn my view, advertising has a profound influence on people’s buying behavior. The strategic use of persuasive language, attractive visuals, and celebrity endorsements can appeal to emotions and subconscious desires, often prompting purchases even when unnecessary. Furthermore, brand storytelling and emotional branding techniques—when executed effectively—can create lasting impressions and brand attachment.\n\nIn conclusion, companies invest vast sums in advertising to enhance their competitiveness and market presence. This, in turn, has a significant impact on consumer behavior, often steering purchasing decisions and shaping broader consumption patterns.",
